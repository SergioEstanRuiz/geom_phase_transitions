*** Quick intro
The aim of this repo is to study geometric phase transitions in models during training, through the lens of singular learning theory. To this end, we are looking at a variety of models and phenomena, including:
- Grokking in modular arithmetic models
- Stagewise Development in LLMs

*** How this repo is structured:
Honestly, it's still a bit of a mess. We'll get it sorted it!
