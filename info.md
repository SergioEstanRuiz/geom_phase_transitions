# Objective
We'll just write down here to remember it 

# Where I am getting the code
We'll try to put here where some of the code was obtained so that we can cite it appropriately
- A lot of it was indirectly taken from Nina Panickssery and Dmitry Vaintrob, and their devinterp repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/nrimsky/devinterp/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file). 
- The above code was also adapted into [this notebook](https://github.com/timaeus-research/devinterp/blob/main/examples/grokking.ipynb) about grokking. This comes from the Timaeus Research team.
